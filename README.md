##### 'Profitability_Analysis_-_Monte_Carlo_Simulation' -
User form predicts the probability of different outcomes with the intervention of random variables. 

Users can change variables in the green cells but must keep away from editing the data in the 'Main' spreadsheet - it will corrupt the user form. 

By pressing the 'RunSimulation' button, the user can change the number of simulations and distributions inside the user form.

After pressing the 'GO' button, please keep in mind that it will take some time to run 1000 simulations inside excel.
So make sure to have a clean cup somewhere around you, or even better - go clean a cup and make yourself a cup of coffee!
