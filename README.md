User form predicts the probability of different outcomes with the intervention of random variables. 

Users can change variables in the green cells but must keep away from editing the data in the 'Main' spreadsheet - it will corrupt the user form. 

By pressing the 'RunSimulation' button, the user can change the number of simulations and distributions inside the user form.

After pressing the 'GO' button, please note that it will take some time to run 1000 simulations inside excel (around 10 min).

So make sure to have a clean cup somewhere around you, or even better - go clean a cup and make yourself a cup of coffee (or a sandwich)!

Another thing to consider is that in the final result, there is a 5% error chance. So even though the simulation's outcome is not 100% accurate - it is still pretty accurate.
